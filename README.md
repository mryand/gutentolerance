# GutenTolerance

Gutenberg can be daunting for those unfamiliar with the interface. This plugin makes Gutenberg easier on new users by labeling many interface elements that otherwise only appear on hover.

## Why this plugin

[Usability research with untrained users at Carleton College](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OJKCAz-W3apnXub7X4hwljVTRtfsqhairAefqXUroAU/edit?usp=sharing) revealed a number of areas where the Gutenberg interface is unintuitive for new and casual WordPress users. This plugin seeks to soften the learning curve based on the recommendations in the report linked above.

## Caution

Rather than recompiling Gutenberg's React components, this plugin applies its magic using mostly CSS and some JS, which interact with Gutenberg's DOM. This plugin may not have full functionality if you are running a bleeding edge version of Gutenberg. If you are aware of an issue, please file an issue and note the version of Gutenberg in which you are seeing the issue.
